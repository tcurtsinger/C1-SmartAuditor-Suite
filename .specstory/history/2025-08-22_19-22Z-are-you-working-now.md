Are you working yet?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I'm working! I can see that you have a workspace called "C1 SmartAuditor Suite" and I have access to all the tools I need to help you with your coding tasks.

Let me check what's currently in your project directory to better understand what we're working with.

I can see that your "C1 SmartAuditor Suite" project directory is currently empty. I'm ready to help you with whatever you'd like to build or work on! 

What would you like to do? Are you looking to:
- Start a new project from scratch?
- Set up a specific type of application (web app, desktop app, etc.)?
- Work on existing code that might be elsewhere?
- Something else entirely?

Just let me know what you have in mind and I'll help you get started!
